# Medical-Cost-Analysis
In today's world, understanding medical costs is crucial for healthcare providers, insurance companies, and policymakers. With rising healthcare expenditures globally, knowing what drives these costs can inform better strategies for cost management and treatment decisions. 


## Dataset
The dataset contains 1338 rows and 8 columns (ID, Age, Sex, BMI, Children, Smoker, Region, Charges)

I embarked on this project to answer two major questions:
1.	What factors most significantly drive healthcare costs?
2.	How can hospitals and insurers use these insights to improve decision-making?

This analysis combines exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and predictive modelling to provide actionable insights that could shape healthcare policy and cost management.
